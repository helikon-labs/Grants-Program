## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

ChainViz Alpha web application, available at [alpha.chainviz.app](https://alpha.chainviz.app), is an [open-source](https://github.com/helikon-labs/chainviz) real-time 3D visualization of the Kusama relay chain block production process.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helikon-labs/chainviz/development/readme_files/screenshot_01.png)

Application in its current alpha version provides the following features:

- 3D visualization of:
  - Active validators, including paravalidation indication
  - Block production by validators
  - Block finalization
- Navigation of the 3D scene through zooming, panning and rotation
- Network status display
- Active validator list and search over identity/address
- Validator details panel upon click on a validator in the 3D model, or the validator list

**This application is to fund the building of the first major version of ChainViz**, with the following features/visualizations:

- Complete professional redesign of the application
- Additional support for Polkadot
- Parachains
  - Assigned paravalidators
  - XCM messages between parachains, or from parachains to relay chains
- Block content on click
  - Extrinsics
  - Events
- Generative sound effects for:
  - Background sound
  - Block production and finalization
  - XCM messages
  - Session and era changes

With these additional features, ChainViz is going to become a **complete real-time visualization** of the Polkadot and Kusama relay chains and their parachains.

### Project Details

#### System Architecture

ChainViz Alpha currently utilizes both [SubVT backend services](https://github.com/helikon-labs/subvt-backend) for Kusama and Polkadot JS API as follows.

- SubVT active validator list [service](https://github.com/helikon-labs/subvt-backend/tree/development/subvt-validator-list-server)
  - List of all active validators
  - For each validator, a summary including:
    - Identity
    - Preferences
    - Self stake
    - Nomination count and total amount,
    - 1KV data if exists
    - and more
- SubVT network status [service](https://github.com/helikon-labs/subvt-backend/tree/development/subvt-network-status-server)
  - Era index
  - Era reward points
  - Total, minimum, maximum and average stake amounts
- Polkadot JS API
  - Finalized block header subscription
    - Utilized to mark finalized blocks
  - Best block header subscription
    - Utilized to display the block production animation
    - Identify uncle blocks and visualize them

ChainViz Alpha system architecture can be illustrated as follows.

</p>

Proposed upgrade to the first major version requires the following additional data:
- Block details
  - Extrinsic list and parameters
    - XCM messages
  - Event list and parameters
- Validator details

Upgraded system architecture can be illustrated as follows, newly added components are colored in yellow:

</p>

Upgraded system utilizes the to-be-developed SubVT Block Details Service to access the block content, and the existing SubVT Validator Details Service for any necessary validator data that is not available through the validator list service.

#### Redesign

TBD

#### Audio Development

ChainViz is going to have an internal audio synthesizer, using the Web Audio API through [Pizzicato](https://github.com/alemangui/pizzicato) or a similar module, that generates parameterized audio for:

- Background
  - Parameterized by blockchain state
- Block production
- XCM messages
- Offline offences
- Era and epoch changes

Please view [ChainSynth Alpha](https://alpha.chainsynth.app) for a similar effort by us. You may find information on how the sound is generated in the [ChainSynth repository](https://github.com/helikon-labs/chainsynth) readme.

### Ecosystem Fit

There is currently no direct match in the Dotsama ecosystem of the features offered by ChainViz. ChainViz Alpha got [shared on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gavofyork/status/1491480880245874708) by Dr. Gavin Wood upon initial release, and received a lot of praise from various Dotsama ecosystem members.

</p>

There are currently two other projects that visualize certain aspects of the Dotsama blockspace:
1. [Kusamaverse by Odyssey](https://odyssey.org/kusamaverse), which is closer to a metaverse space for Kusama, focused more on the interaction of the actors in the ecosystem.
2. [XCM Dashboard](https://polkadot.subscan.io/xcm_dashboard) by the Subscan team, which is a visualization of the cross-chain messaging channels between parachains.

ChainViz is unique in that it focuses on a very clear real-time visualization of the internals of the Dotsama machine. As we're going to explain in the Future Plans section, it also has the potential to have educational, entertainment and functional value through future development.
